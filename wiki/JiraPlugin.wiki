Greenbridge can gather its stories and scenarios from Jira.

Here is an example of configuring the greenbridge plugin:

{{{
 <build>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>com.googlecode.greenbridge</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-greenbridge-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>1.0.1</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>generate-sources</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>stories</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <packageName>com.application.reference</packageName>
                            <storyHarvester implementation="com.googlecode.greenbridge.storyharvester.impl.JiraStoryHarvester">
                                <jiraRootUrl>http://akljira001:8080</jiraRootUrl>
                                <jiraUser>remote_user</jiraUser>
                                <jiraPassword>remote_password</jiraPassword>
                                <jiraFilterURL>http://akljira001:8080/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/11326/SearchRequest-11326.xml?tempMax=1000</jiraFilterURL>
                                <!-- <jiraFilterURL>file:///SearchRequest.xml</jiraFilterURL> -->
                                <storyTypeId>9</storyTypeId>
                                <scenarioTypeId>11</scenarioTypeId>
                            </storyHarvester>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>

Some notes:
  * The jiraUser and jiraPassword are for an actual jira user. The connection is not through the remote api.
  * The jiraFilterURL is the link to the XML filter view for a project. This must be accessible by the above user
  * You can link to a local xml file that adheres to the jira format.
  * The xml jira spits out sometimes is not well formed. Just watch out for special characters.
  * The storyTypeId and scenarioTypeId are optional. By default, parent jira's become stories and children become scenarios. You can filter this further by specifying a jira type for each. But scenarios always have to be a sub-issue.
  * The summary and the description of the jira go into the narrative.
